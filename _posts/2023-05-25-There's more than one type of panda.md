## Red Pandas are awesome!

On the first day of playing around with example 00 "is it a bird" when I updated the code to accept ten animals one of the animals I was searching for was panda. Much to my surprise there was this funny fox looking red thingo that kept popping up. I was convinced duckduckgo was more duckduckstay. 

Please let me know if you liked my joke. If you didnt shhhhhh I dont need to know. 

When the funny looking panda showed up I skimmed through the code to make sure it wasnt slowai. I soon found out it wasnt fastai that was slow it was just me who never knew about RED PANDAS!!!!!

They are so cute!!!!

So I asked ChatGPT to make a table about Red Panda lovers and Normal Panda lovers hope you like it x. 

|                   | Pandas | Red Pandas | Panda Lovers | Red Panda Lovers | Panda Non-Lovers | Red Panda Non-Lovers |
|-------------------|:------:|:----------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| **Cuteness Factor** | High   | Extra High | Extreme High | Over the Top     | Deniers of Cuteness | Suspected Robot Overlords |
| **Fav. Bamboo Meal** | Daily | Daily+      | Only on Panda Dates | Special Occasions | Prefer Steak | "What's a bamboo?" |
| **Fluffy Tail**   | Nope | Yup | Wish they had one | Have a fluffy pillow | "What's the fuss about?" | "Give me a reptile any day" |
| **Climbing Trees**| Nope | Yes, please | Only if a panda is stuck up there | "I climbed a tree once..." | "That's what ladders are for!" | "I don't go outside" |
| **Typical Weekends** | Eating, Sleeping | Playing, Climbing, Eating, Sleeping | Watching panda videos | Watching red panda GIFs | "Pandas? Meh" | "Red whaaat?" |

Even though above may seem like a silly post there is actually some valid take aways from this finding that relates to the task at hand for question 2. 

We must be systematic even when choosing search terms for the animals that we use when classifying. Out of the 200 odd images for Pandas some are bound to be Red Pandas. 

This error will apply to other animals as well. So It is important to try and use 10 animals that are clearly different in apperance and within that be specific to the type. Maybe dont use general terms like "Pandas" use "Pandas Black and White" etc.
