# **00-is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data.ipynb**

After much trouble I managed to run successfully run the is it a bird example on the fastai course. I beilieve one of the error is duckduckgo is scraping an image which has a file extension the python script cannot handle then again what do I know.

I managed to successfully carry on as the jupyter notebook allows for me to pick up from the next line of code and even with the errors the code manages to snag enough pictures of birds. 

My undestanding of the 00 example in fastai course is its a tutorial on how to construct a deep learning model to seperate images into relevant categories. It uses python librarires and fastai to perform these tasks. It is fascinating to see the success rate of pre-trained models. 

**My key takeaways from this example:**
1. Ive never used DuckDuckGo before for anything its such a powerful tool!
2. I had no idea how high-level FastAi was before beginning I was expecting to have hundreds of lines of code to achieve a minor task. 
3. The tutorial was really good on teaching us how to prepare the data for being used for the task. Creating directories, storing images for training. Also the section about cleaning corrupted files was very helpful.
4.
