## Final Thoughts on Machines That Can Learn and Intelligence That Is Artificial

Today is the due date for assignment 3 and I can confirm the first question has been my favourite assignment question from any course this year. Very rarely do we get to excercise total freedom in creativity as engineering students in assignments.

From ELEC4630 and FastAI I've learnt alot about all the advanced applications this technology has and it is amazing! We even got to try some out ourselves. The medical imaging scene is about to change rapidly and its very exciting!

I'm also excited to see how Autonomous Vehicle technology changes over the coming years as well.

From the assignment I learnt some valualbe lessons about t-SNE and Confusion Matrices.

## What are confusion matrices?
|                     | Actual Positive | Actual Negative |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Predicted Positive  | True Positive (TP)  | False Positive (FP) |
| Predicted Negative  | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN)  |

This is a very useful tool for statistics and machine learning (I wonder if theres an inverse confusion matrix). You will find an explanation for the matrix in my solution for question 2.
