# **First Post**

Day 1: I decided until I get ideas on what to make other posts about Ill simply just document my process with q2 and q3 of the assignment like any other blog. Are you even a student if starting an assignment didnt include procrastinating and general web browsing? Today my procrastination browsing included asking ChatGPT to write Haikus about image processing. I will begin by reveiwing them.

First Entry: 
Pixels in a dance,
Light and shadow in balance,
Image's romance.

Meh, its okay 5/10 - Imagine this in my best Simon Cowell voice

Second Entry:
Process at night's fall,
Reveals secrets, big and small,
In pictures we scrawl.

Its getting better 7/10
